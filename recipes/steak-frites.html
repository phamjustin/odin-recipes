        <li>Place fries in oil pot, occasionally stirring to prevent fries from sticking to eachother or pot</li>
        <li>Remove steak from frying pan and let rest</li>
        <li>In the same frying pan the steak was in, pour in white wine to deglaze the pan</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream and dijon mustard, adjust according to taste</li>
        <li>Once sauce is at preferred taste levels and has thickened up a bit, add chopped chives</li>
        <li>When fries are finished, remove from pot and place on paper towel to remove excess oil</li>
        <li>After steak has thoroughly rested (at least 15 minutes) cut into slices to plate</li>
        <li>Plate the slices of steak alongside fries and generously drizzle over steak (enough sauce to dip fries in)</li>
